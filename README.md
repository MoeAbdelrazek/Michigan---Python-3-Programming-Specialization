Python 3 Programming Specialization – University of Michigan
This repository contains all project work from the Python 3 Programming Specialization offered by the University of Michigan.
Throughout the specialization, I’ll be completing a series of hands-on assignments that cover:
- File handling and automation
- Functions and modular design
- Dictionaries and data structures
- Object-oriented programming
- Error handling and defensive coding
- Working with CSV, JSON, and web data
Each project will be archived in its own folder with code, documentation, and visual proof of completion.
More projects will be added as the specialization progresses.
